## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
This final examination is focused on creating a resume type website with distinct pages, while also integrating a page dedicated to showcasing past projects. The purpose of this Project is to combine everything that you have learned and create something unique.

Key elements of my website include 3D effects and a Hover effects. I utilized perspective to add a three-dimensional effect to the title on my 'About Me' page. I used hover effect for inverting the colors.
Additionally, I used z-index to create a text-stroke effect on specific areas of an image.

The technologies that I used were HTML and CSS. I used HTML for the contents and structure of the website and CSS to design the contents in order for it to look good.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```

|   └─ css
|   |   └─ style.css
|   └─ img
